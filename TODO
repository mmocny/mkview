- execute os.system("grep...") or execute some python equivalent.
- filter out empties, since they are most often useless.
- since a subprocess cannot change executing shells' current directory, come up with best strategies/workarounds, currently we just print the target dir, so you can cd $(mkview ...)

- Build and indexer!

Ideas:
- We match data, what about filenames/paths?
- Idea: grep is just one of any command/pipe stream.  Perhaps instead of a query, we accept a textual pipe? "filter" command?
