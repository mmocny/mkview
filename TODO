- mkview returns the target directory.  you can run cd $(mkview query) to hop there after you are done (or pushd).  We should add to the README a list of valuable shell alias commands to do this for you.

- Build an indexer!

Ideas:
- We match data, what about filenames/paths?
- Idea: grep is just one of any command/pipe stream.  Perhaps instead of a query, we accept a textual pipe? "filter" command?
